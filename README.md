# UCLA-CS32-2019

CS 32 taken Spring 2019 with Professor Smallberg. Grade Received: A.

All of the projects are uploaded here exactly as they were turned in. Some projects had specific requirements for how the files were to be submitted and thus might not be fully complete and ready to build in these versions. The intention of this upload is not for current CS 32 students to use these projects for their class, please view them at your own discretion. Nonetheless, enjoy! I had a lot of fun taking CS 32 and creating these projects!
